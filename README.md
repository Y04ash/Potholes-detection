This project implements a pothole detection model using YOLOv8n.pt (You Only Look Once). The model is trained on a custom dataset to detect potholes in images and annotate them accordingly.

Precision: 0.87 (High accuracy in detecting potholes)

Recall: 0.64 (Moderate, some potholes are missed)

mAP@50: 0.70 (Decent detection capability)

mAP@50-95: 0.34 (Needs improvement for generalization)
